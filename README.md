# INTRODUCTION
This is a simple simple to explain how to run the application made by:
Alexis Ledoux, Charles NIVESSE, Mathis MEROLLA, Baptiste MARCHAL for an IOS2 project
in networks architectures in ESILV 
# PREREQUITIES
1. You must install python version 3.7 or later : https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. make sure you have environnements variables set up (especially py/python)
# WINDOWS
launch startWindows.bat
# LINUX
launch startLinux.sh
# OTHER METHOD
launch Interface.py directly
# GETTING THE CODE
You should have all the code in the project folder. If you want, the source code is also
on github.com : https://github.com/Jadinks/Mail_box
You can fork it if you want :)
# HOW TO USE
You should follow what's written on the console.
Each time you want to communicate with a distant webmail server (sending and receiving),
you are asked to put a mail address and a password. You can use both Gmail and Outlook with
any email address, but be aware that non-secure third parties apps should be able to read
mails. We did two email addresses that are ready to do that:
-GMAIL: projetiosnetwork@gmail.com /PASSWORD: projectisfun
-OUTLOOK : projetiosnetwork@outlook.fr /PASSWORD: projectisfunOutlook
